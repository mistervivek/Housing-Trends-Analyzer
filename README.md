US Housing Trends Analyzer and Influence Explorer
Objective
This project aims to develop a data science model to analyze and predict U.S. home prices over the past 20 years, focusing on the impact of critical economic factors.

Steps
1. Data Collection
Source: S&P Case-Shiller Home Price Index data from the Federal Reserve Economic Data (FRED) platform.

Factors Considered: Per Capita GDP, Consumer Price Index (CPI), Construction Material Costs, Median Income, Subsidies, Population Demographics, and other key indicators.

2. Data Preparation
Processed data by handling missing values, standardizing date formats, and addressing outliers to ensure accuracy.

3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Performed EDA to examine variable distributions, identify correlations, and visualize trends over two decades.

4. Model Development
Tested multiple regression models: Linear Regression, ElasticNet, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, Support Vector Regression (SVR), and XGBoost.

Evaluated model performance using metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared.

5. Feature Importance Analysis
Analyzed significant contributors to home price fluctuations through models like Random Forest, XGBoost, and Gradient Boosting.

6. Model Evaluation and Selection
Compared model outputs to determine the best fit, balancing predictive accuracy with interpretability.

7. Visualization
Created charts to compare actual vs. predicted home prices and highlight the significance of various features.

Results
Identified the most effective model based on its low MSE and high R-squared values.

Gained insights into economic factors influencing U.S. home prices over the last 20 years.

Conclusion
This project enhances our understanding of U.S. housing market trends and offers a reliable framework for predictive modeling in the real estate sector.
